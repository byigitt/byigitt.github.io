        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Barış, a 21-year-old junior software student at Cankaya
          University. My journey in software began in high school, where I
          started by hosting a server for my favorite game. This sparked a deep
          interest in technology, leading me to explore various programming
          languages and tools. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skillset
          in the field of software engineering.
